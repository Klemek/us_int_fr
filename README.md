# us_int_fr
Alternative US international keyboard layout to write french (make french accents reachable only with `Alt Gr`)

Use `usinfrX.klc` to install this layout on the french variant and `usinenX.klc` for the english variant (does not change the layout but recognized by Windows as a specific language)

> Unfortunately Windows makes it hard to upgrade an existing layout so I have to increment the version number on each update.

See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Klemek/bfc376fa9afa84234a1d8b2ed685fffb) for the Linux layout.
